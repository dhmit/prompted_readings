Although I’ve read many novels in my time as a student, the idea of rereading never spoke out to me very much. 
For the most part, I was just reading the novels that were assigned to me and remembering the events that occurred in 
them. To me, the symbols in a story were someone else’s problem. If anything, rereading was a punishment, since I was 
assigned to read The Great Gatsby, a book I was apathetic to, three times. Throughout these readings, I hardly gained 
any deeper insight, since I was only rereading to refresh my memory on plot points I had forgotten. Each subsequent 
reading felt like a waste of time.

Now that I’ve had the chance to work on the Reading Redux project, I’ve gained a far more positive view of rereading. 
Sandy’s demonstrations taught me the value in close reading and how it allows for discovering new insights about both an
 individual text and the place that a text held in the development of future works. I actually enjoyed reading
  through Recitatif multiple times and noting the different places where my views of Twyla and Roberta were defined. 


I found the group discussions to be enlightening, as I was exposed to different views on race and stereotypes that 
others formed after reading Recitatif. Unlike in high school, student’s interpretations were accepted as equally valid 
views. I was no longer urged to remember the details that my teacher found important. Instead, I was able to use my 
intuition to find my own evidence for my beliefs about the story’s meaning and the characters’ motivations.

Recitatif is an especially interesting story for a rereading experiment, since it was created with ambiguity in mind. 
If another story had been chosen for this project, I don’t know if I would have formed the same opinion on rereading. 
The idea that my preconceptions of race were being constantly challenged by the narrative felt refreshing. Had I read a 
book that didn’t challenge my views in such a way, rereading for this project may have felt more like rereading The 
Great Gatsby, and my view on rereading would have still been rather negative.

Although I don’t think I would consider a full time career rereading and analyzing texts, I have a newfound respect for 
those who do. Without people to analyze fiction, the experiences of people like Toni Morrison would be forgotten. 
Through rereading these stories, we learn not only about the events of the past, but about the nuances behind them, and 
how the everyday person was affected by them.

I’m glad to have been able to work with rereading because I was able to step out of my comfort zone in the technical 
sphere. I hope that through further projects with the digital humanities lab, I will be able to explore more areas of 
the humanities that I have yet to embrace.
