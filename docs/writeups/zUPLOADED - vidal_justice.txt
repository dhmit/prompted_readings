After working on the reading project, a function that I found interesting is the compute_reread_counts function. The function collects the average number of times the participants reread a segment for each segment. The function increases the rereading count of the segment if the participant is on the segment for a second or longer. It iterates through all the segment data and increases the number of times a segment has been reread if the participant has remained on the segment long enough. If the participant is treading the segment for the first time, then the rereading count is set to 1.

The average rereading count for a segment is helpful in evaluating the impacts of rereading because it quantifies a participant’s rereading. Knowing the average amount of time that a person reread a segment can give insight into how difficult the passage was to understand relative to the others. In a classroom setting, this information can be useful to help educators focus parts of the text that students are having trouble interpreting and give students insight on what details and clues they can look for to create an understanding and efficiently reread. It is important that students efficiently reread, in the sense that they get a better understanding when rereading text as little times as possible because several rereads alone do not guarantee increased understanding and comprehension.

In the future it might be interesting to determine the mode amount of time it takes a person to click through a segment to another segment, to implement an exact lower threshold for recording the person’s time on a segment as a "reread". If the lower threshold is too low, then people will be counted as “rereading” even if they are simply just passing over a segment to get to another one. If it is too high, then the readers may be able to look back at a document without it being counted as rereading. It might be possible to prevent this problem by allowing the reader to jump directly to another question from the one they are on. For example, a reader would be able to jump to page 1 from page 5 by pressing the page 1 button. It would also be useful to record how long each participant spent rereading each time they revisited a segment as another way to gauge the impact of rereading. If the second time a person took to read a passage is shorter than the first, it might suggest that the person had a better understanding of the text after having read it the first time. If the second time was longer, then it suggests that the reader needed to take more time to review the text to understand what it was saying.
