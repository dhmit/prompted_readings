<p>One of the most important ideas for the project was the ability to draw out responses and ideas from the reader, but
more specifically those that they may get after being exposed to a given reading the second time. While there is, of
course, no definite way to track that a user has actually read the document a second time, there are several things
that we have implemented in this project that help prompt guide users to read the section again, as well as improve
their ability to provide feedback.</p>

<p>The first, and most noticeable, aspect of this is the fact that the reading pages only allow a user to answer questions
after acknowledging that they have read a given section. This prevents a reader from being exposed to a large “wall of
text” from the start, and breaks it down into manageable segments. Additionally, even after the user indicates that
they have read the section, the text still displays to the side of the questions and allows for a user to scroll back
through the reading while looking for insights, contexts, or other information that they would want. Document-level
questions are also displayed at each section, with persisting answers that allow for a reader to see how they have
been interpreting a document so far, and for them to compare that with how they currently feel. This breakdown of the
text into readings with and without questions is a very close representation of how a user may read a text if they had a
paper copy of it and were allowed to simply flip through the pages naturally. Displaying the information in this way
allows for it to become another means for a user to answer certain questions as well.</p>

<p>With the inclusion of the text right next to question prompts, users are also able to associate parts of a text with
their responses by simply highlighting a segment from the displayed text. This once again emulates the use of paper
copies while allowing for easier data collection. Because a user is allowed to associate text with their responses,
not only does it provide researchers a broader view into the way that a user is reading, but it also allows a user to
identify for themselves what gave them a certain idea, and provides opportunities for them to reference it again should
they find new inspiration. This ability invites the readers to more thoroughly investigate parts of the text, and have
a clearer link between their thoughts, rather than simply facing a potentially overwhelming text display without
interactivity. This allows for some engagement to happen at the frontend, as well as allowing for more data to be
collected from the reading.</p>
