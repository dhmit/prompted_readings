Making the Reading View
As an avid reader myself, I know how important an interface can be to my overall reading experience. Text too small can strain my eyes and give me a headache, text too dense can be off-putting, etc. Now that I read on my phone or iPad, I’ve gotten even more particular about the platforms I will read on. I had fun using my personal experience to help with the overall design of the front-end application.

The first and most important thing to me was picking a font. We wanted a font that made it feel more like you were reading a story or novel, and not an article or piece of academic work. I chose the font Garamond, as it gave me the most novelesque vibes. It’s simple and not distracting, but it has subtle embellishments and is a bit rounded. The font is the first thing readers will see when they open up a reading assignment. From my own personal experience, the way I approach recreational reading and assigned reading are very different. I usually approach assigned reading more negatively, so I wanted our front-end app to look as close to a book one might read recreationally as possible.

Next was the number of words on the page. You don’t want the text to stretch for too wide on the page, but you also don’t want it to be too narrow. There is an optimal range, and that is approximately the width of an average hardcover book.

We also made the text its own personal division so readers could scroll through it without scrolling the entire page, and did the same thing with the reading questions. This was done so that readers could look at questions and the text at the same time and eliminate needless scrolling that might make it frustrating to answer questions.

Knowing that you will be asked particular questions about a text might impact the way you read it as well, so we added a feature that allows readers to view just the text before viewing the questions. That way, you can read it the first time and come to your own conclusions or intuitions before rereading while looking for clues to answer guided questions.

Implementing these features will hopefully positively impact the reading and rereading experience of our users. We aimed to give the page as authentic and novelesque a feel as possible and used these tools to try to achieve that.
