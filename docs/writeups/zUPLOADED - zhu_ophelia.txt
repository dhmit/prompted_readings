As we began planning the user interface of the application, I noticed how the format of an initial cold read and a later reread encourages rereading through the button that renders next page with the same text and questions. Rather than having questions available in the beginning, the two sections of the text forces the reader to look at the text again, this time with the influence of questions. It prevents the reader from simply reading with the purpose to answer the questions, and instead encourages reading with the purpose of understanding the first time.
The desire to reread might include the purpose of their reading the text. For example, if the purpose is for understanding, the readers may desire rereading, whereas the purpose of completing an assignment or prompt encourages the reader to look for targeted information and be done with the text. In addition, tools to help annotate can encourage rereading, while simply setting the text before the reader provides no incentive to reread if the process looks the same as the first read. On the other hand, note-taking and highlighting tools encourage the reader to interact with the text again, but in a different way.
I enjoyed contributing to the highlighting tool because selecting specific parts of a text and referencing it is an integral part of rereading, which is made possible by this tool. It provides a more unique functionality to the application other than simply typing answers to a question or typing annotations. I enjoyed working with the implementation of the evidence data structure in the code and using React elements in order to display the evidence. I believe that the highlighting tool not only encourages the reader to reread, but that it also provides insight on what parts of the text the reader finds relevant to a specific question and which parts they believe are important.
