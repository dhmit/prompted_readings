Funing Yang: Roaming Through Literature Using Computational Tools


<p>
As a double major in Computer Science and English literature, I’m always passionate about the role that technology plays in the field of humanities. What the technology can achieve? And what it cannot? Throughout the semester, I enhanced my understanding in both the tools that we used to build the analytic tools as well as the literature pieces and literary theory of rereading. In my essay, I’ll be discussing both my achievement as a computer scientist as well as a humanist.

My role for the technical project is a combination of backend analysis, database creation, and front-end display. Our study started with the Hemingway’s six-word short story: “baby shoes for sale never worn”. We’ve designed a short online study that prompted the user to sum up how did the story make them feel in three words. The question appeared twice, each time with different context: the first time, “an ad”; the second time, “this is actually a short story”. I’m interested in the differences in people’s responses with the shifted temporal and context. Furthermore, what words did people choose in their responses and what’s the differences between the two answers? Through continuously asking the research questions, eventually I realized I wanted to investigate whether there’s a pattern of people’s unique responses with two different context, thus, I designed the function using Python the programming language to find out if there’s a pattern with the unique words used in people’s responses as the responses accumulated. My discovery is quite interesting: there seemed to be a threshold of the unique words used in the responses, and as more and more responses were being analyzed, the number of unique words stayed nearly constant. The result remained the same for both response dataset with different context, which implied that the amount of unique words, when people were pressed to submit a brief answer with the word limit, was rather limited. Besides designing analytical functions like the above one, I also honed my computer science skills through learning about Django database, React framework, as well as how to make the front-end and the back-end “talk” to each other, and to be able to apply my knowledge for them right away. Through this project, I realized that I love software development and want to pursue it further.

On the literary side, I enriched my understanding as a literature student of Tony Morrison’s text, Recitatif. And I absolutely love the times when I am immersed in the texts and discussing the theory of professional rereading with my peers. The study undoubtedly provided me with no perspectives about how to approach literature and rereading.

The project is officially “finished”, but there’re still so many research questions to probe into, to answer (or attempt to answer), through a combination of computational tools and humanistic inquiry. For instance, currently our source texts used for the study are the six-word study as well as Morrison’s short narrative, but for the further generalization and the broader application of the tool, we need to expand our database and think of ways to generalize our analysis functions without losing too much specificity. Also, we can polish the front-end user interface to make it more engaging to the audience to encourage rereading.
