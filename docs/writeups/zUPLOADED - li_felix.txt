The Tug and Pull Between Professional Rereading Happening To and For Students

<p>
There exists a fine boundary between professional rereading happening for and to students. The methodology behind rereading has almost always seemed, at least in my schooling experience, like a mandatory task. Rereading after rereading brought about more convoluted and extraneous meanings out of a text, rather than inciting profound revelations. Different readings would contradict one another and soon enough after looking at a text a few too many times the “meaning” would become meaningless. Eyes glazing over familiar yet unfamiliar words — there becomes a distinction between professional rereading being a tool or a chore.

Being told by a teacher to reread a certain section and to focus on a certain theme or question felt like a structured manner to find natural meaning. This sharp contrast between the need to find a certain meaning and the organic way that the reading presents itself to the reader felt ununited by the methods for professional rereading. Specifically, a certain theme or idea is often imposed on a reader when conducting a rereading causing the reader to search and hunt for specific details that may cause them to forgo other interpretations of a text. Reflecting on past professional rereading activities there is no clear method that completely alleviates this push and pull between professional rereading happening for and to students. However, there are patterns and strategies that stand out to me that have helped guide rereadings to be an effective tool.

It is clear that all readers read and interact with a text differently. What has been an effective form of “rereading” was being able to read different annotations of a specific text or hearing and engaging in a discussion of a text. Afterwards, rereading the text feels a lot more natural having been exposed to other ideas instead of being imposed specific themes from a teacher. Being told to hunt for a specific symbol and to extract a certain meaning felt far more manual and oftentimes made rereading feel more chore-like. Instead of being exposed to different interpretations and then being told to reread with these themes in mind felt far more organic almost mimicking certain aspects of rereading for pleasure.

An interesting exercise that my high school literature teacher, Mr. Gallagher, had us participate in brought about many of the effective parts of rereading while keeping it an engaging activity. He had us read the same sections but rotate through groups on different days and didn’t allow for us to repeat an idea brought about in a previous discussion. This discussion strategy forced us to reread parts of text and to expand on previous themes and ideas. I often found myself rereading section after section keeping in mind certain themes that were touched upon and trying to find both new ideas but also ideas that built off of other themes. It was an extremely effective means of discussion to allow for professional rereading to be as organic as possible.

More methods surrounding how to make professional rereading more effective and engaging can be created from seeing how readers interact with text and how a rereading can bring about new meanings. Being able to see the process and progress behind answering these questions has been an extremely rewarding part of this semester. It has been a great experience to have had the chance to produce a product that sits at the intersection between Humanities and STEM in hopes of driving more effective rereading methods. There still remains many questions in regards to the effect that rereading has on understanding but I am hopeful that more research will bring about more answers to this.
